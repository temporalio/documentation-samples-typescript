/**
 * Type definitions for the Worker end of the sinks mechanism.
 *
 * Sinks are a mechanism for exporting data from the Workflow isolate to the
 * Node.js environment, they are necessary because the Workflow has no way to
 * communicate with the outside World.
 *
 * Sinks are typically used for exporting logs, metrics and traces out from the
 * Workflow.
 *
 * Sink functions may not return values to the Workflow in order to prevent
 * breaking determinism.
