/**
 * A decorator to be used on error classes. It adds the 'name' property AND provides a custom
 * 'instanceof' handler that works correctly across execution contexts.
 *
 * ### Details ###
 *
 * According to the EcmaScript's spec, the default behavior of JavaScript's `x instanceof Y` operator is to walk up the
 * prototype chain of object 'x', checking if any constructor in that hierarchy is _exactly the same object_ as the
 * constructor function 'Y'.
 *
 * Unfortunately, it happens in various situations that different constructor function objects get created for what
 * appears to be the very same class. This leads to surprising behavior where `instanceof` returns false though it is
 * known that the object is indeed an instance of that class. One particular case where this happens is when constructor
 * 'Y' belongs to a different realm than the constuctor with which 'x' was instantiated. Another case is when two copies
 * of the same library gets loaded in the same realm.
 *
 * In practice, this tends to cause issues when crossing the workflow-sandboxing boundary (since Node's vm module
 * really creates new execution realms), as well as when running tests using Jest (see https://github.com/jestjs/jest/issues/2549
 * for some details on that one).
 *
 * This function injects a custom 'instanceof' handler into the prototype of 'clazz', which is both cross-realm safe and
 * cross-copies-of-the-same-lib safe. It works by adding a special symbol property to the prototype of 'clazz', and then
 * checking for the presence of that symbol.
